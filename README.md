# FraudDetection
I couldn't add the CSV file because it exceeded the size limit and was too large
This project implements and compares two machine learning approaches for credit card fraud detection: Logistic Regression and Isolation Forest. The code utilizes GridSearchCV to tune model parameters for optimal performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.
Features

Analysis of credit card transaction data
Implementation of Logistic Regression with class weight tuning
Implementation of Isolation Forest with contamination parameter tuning
Custom scoring function to balance precision and recall
Visualization of model performance across different parameter values

The repository demonstrates how to handle highly imbalanced datasets and optimize fraud detection algorithms to minimize both false positives and false negatives, which are critical considerations in financial security applications.
